tessel-ambient-leds
===================

Tessel project using the ambient module and a strand of neopixels. Potential use case as a baby monitor.

A flight attendant once told me how much he liked his plane's new overhead LED lgihting because they could change it to blue, and the babies would stop crying.  I had never heard this, but many people do say this is true (of course, there is also research that says it's red, etc.). Either way, this project is hypothetical as a baby monitor in that it listens for crying, and will gently turn the lights on and let them linger before fading out.

## Required

- Tessel
- Ambient module
- Neopixels (currently set up to use a 60-led strand)
